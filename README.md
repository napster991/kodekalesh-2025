# Mental Wellbeing Monitoring & Doctor Appointment Platform
# KodeKalesh 2025 — Team: Napster

### Problem Statement
Mental-wellbeing services remain severely constrained by limited clinical manpower, inconsistent self-reporting, and the absence of continuous behavioural monitoring. Individuals experiencing early psychological stress indicators often remain undetected until symptoms intensify. Institutions, workplaces, and healthcare systems are consequently unable to provide timely interventions, leading to escalated crises and long-term societal burdens.
